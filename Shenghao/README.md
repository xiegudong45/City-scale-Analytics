## Update for what I've done

### Nov.8.2018
I've upload some work I did today in week6 dir. You need to first download 2 files in data folder, which is sidewalks.geojson and trails.geojson so that you can run my code. If you just want to see the result, you can just download sidewalk_trails.geojson.

More specific detail is shown in README.md in week6.
