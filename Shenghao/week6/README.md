### update 1:
I just merged the data from sidewalks.geojson and trails.geojson. For some reason I wrote the code in Jupyter Notebook.

To begin with, you need to download sidewalks.geojson and trails.geojson. If you want to run the code, you may alter the sidewalks.geojson and trails.geojson directory in your local machine. The output file is named as sidewalk_trails.geojson.

I tried to put the file in the Tableau and it seems that it has no problem to show the two layers which is sidewalk and trail. you can drag 'type' to color in the Marks to see the results.

If you have any question, please let me know. Thanks!
